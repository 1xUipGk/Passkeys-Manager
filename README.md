# Password Manager App Roadmap

## Overview
This Password Manager is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Firebase as the backend for data storage and authentication. The app allows users to create, save, and manage passwords with additional features for viewing, editing, and deleting them, plus a password strength check feature.

---

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Structure

- **Authentication Page**:
  - Create a simple login page to authenticate users.
  - Implement Firebase for managing user login sessions.

- **Dashboard Layout**:
  - Design a dashboard page in HTML and CSS, displaying all saved passwords.
  - Implement a search bar to easily locate saved passwords.

## Phase 2: Core Password Management

- **Password Creation Form**:
  - Create a form to add app/service names and enter passwords.
  - Add a JavaScript-based password generator that allows custom options (length, complexity).
  - Store new passwords securely in Firebase.

- **Password Viewing and Copying**:
  - Add buttons to view or copy each saved password using JavaScript event handling.
  - Implement a basic edit feature to modify saved passwords.

- **Password Deletion**:
  - Add a delete button for each password entry.
  - Implement a confirmation prompt before deleting any entry to prevent accidental deletions.

## Phase 3: Password Security and Validation

- **Password Security Check**:
  - Add a feature on the dashboard to check the strength of each saved password.
  - Display an indicator for weak, medium, and strong passwords.
  - Optionally, integrate an external API for checking password breaches, if possible.

## Phase 4: Basic Security Enhancements

- **Encryption**:
  - Use JavaScript-based encryption (like crypto-js) to encrypt passwords before storing in Firebase.

- **Auto Logout**:
  - Implement a basic JavaScript timer to auto logout after a period of inactivity to enhance security.

## Phase 5: UI/UX Enhancements

- **User Notifications**:
  - Show simple notification messages using JavaScript when actions (copy, delete, edit) are completed.

- **Categorization Feature**:
  - Allow users to categorize passwords by type (e.g., Social, Work, Finance) to organize saved entries.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implement error messages for failed actions (e.g., network issues or failed deletions).

---

## Future Phases (Optional)
- **Export/Import Feature**:
  - Implement basic JavaScript functionality to export/import passwords in a secure format.

- **Dark Mode**:
  - Add a toggle for dark mode using CSS.

## Completion Goals

1. **Phase 1 & 2**: Initial MVP with basic password storage and retrieval functionality.
2. **Phase 3 & 4**: Improved security and password validation features.
3. **Phase 5**: UI/UX enhancements for better usability and user experience.
